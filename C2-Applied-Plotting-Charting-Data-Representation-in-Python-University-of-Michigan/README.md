# Applied Plotting Charting Data Representation in Python - University of Michigan
This is second Course in the specialization Data science with Python offered by University of Michigan.

## Week 1
This week covers basic principles of Information Visualization and is divided in 3 parts
1. [The Visualization wheel (Alberto Cairo)](https://github.com/sumitkant/UoM_C2_Applied_Plotting_Charting_DataRep/wiki/Week-1.1-Visualization-Wheel)
2. [Graphical Heuristics (Edward Tufte)](https://github.com/sumitkant/UoM_C2_Applied_Plotting_Charting_DataRep/wiki/Week-1.2-Graphical-Heuristics)
3. [Truthful art principles (Alberto Cairo)](https://github.com/sumitkant/UoM_C2_Applied_Plotting_Charting_DataRep/wiki/Week-1.3:-Qualities-of-Good-Visualization)

## Week 2
This week covers the `matplotlib` architecture and hands on `matplotlib.pyplot` to create scatterplots, line charts, bar charts and Dejunkifying plots. You can find the complete notebook [here](https://github.com/sumitkant/UoM_C2_Applied_Plotting_Charting_DataRep/blob/master/Week%202/Week2.ipynb)

This week's assignment covered working with real world CSV weather data. Data was manipulated to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates. Additionally, a composite chart was created by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking data for a given year. The complete notebook is [here](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Applied_Plotting_Charting_and_DataRepresentation/blob/master/Week%202/Assignment2.ipynb)

## Week 3
This week covers subplots, histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps, Interactivit and animation using matplotlib. The complete notebook is [here](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Applied_Plotting_Charting_and_DataRepresentation/blob/master/Week%203/Week3.ipynb)
Also, this week's assignment was to build a custom visualization. Some Interactive viualization that I build is in [this](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Applied_Plotting_Charting_and_DataRepresentation/blob/master/Week%203/Assignment%203.ipynb) notebok.

## Week 4
Final week covers introduction to `seaborn` and plotting with `pandas`. The complete notebook is [here](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Applied_Plotting_Charting_and_DataRepresentation/blob/master/Week%204/Week4.ipynb). The final week's assignment was to find a dataset, develop a research question and finally answer it using visulaization. The [pdf file](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Applied_Plotting_Charting_and_DataRepresentation/blob/master/Week%204/Assignment%204.pdf) and [source code](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Applied_Plotting_Charting_and_DataRepresentation/blob/master/Week%204/Assignment4.ipynb) is also included.
